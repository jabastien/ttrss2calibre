ttrss2calibre

Generates a calibre news recipe of unread TTRSS feeds

The result is one calibre recipe consisting of all the single RSS feeds of a
TinyTiny RSS (TTRSS) installation.  The feeds point to
public.php?op=rss&view_mode=unread&id=1key=abcde123" and are therefore readable
without login.

In order for this script to work the TTRSS installation has to be patched.
Please add the following case statement to api/index.html:

               case "getFeedAccessKey":
                        $feed_id=db_escape_string($_REQUEST["feed_id"]);
                        $feeds = get_feed_access_key($link, $feed_id, false);
                        print api_wrap_reply(API_STATUS_OK, $seq, $feeds);
                        break;

Background: Currently there is no API to get the feed specific access keys.
